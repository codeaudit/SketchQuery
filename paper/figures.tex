For each invariant, assuming a ``spike'' shaped query (the black line), the signal represented by the dotted line would count as a valid match. The analyst's intended meaning of a query might have several implicit or explicit invariants. The analyst might have a different list of what features are or are not relevant during an analysis session. In order to support the analyst, visual query systems ought to flexibly and dynamically support the inclusion or exclusion of these invariants.  }

		\caption{Results from our evaluation. Participants were given a target time series, and then had to judge the similarity of the target to a potential match, to which an invariant had been applied. Heterogeneity of human responses show that not all changes to time series result in perceived difference across all viewers. Values are not comparable across conditions, however, slopes are significant: a negative slope represents a sensitivity (similarity falls as the factor increases), while a horizontal line suggests an invariance. This same dataset was then applied to the matching algorithms we present in this paper. Algorithms had varying slopes across the invariants, showing different initial affordances. For instance, additive noise has a significant negative effect on perceived match strength (negative slope). However, only Hough Voting and MSE matching algorithms share a significant negative slope in their match quality as noise is added. Hough Voting and MSE therefore match human judgments of similarity with respect to noise, whereas DTW is invariant to this factor. These data show that algorithmic approaches must be flexible enough to capture the varied mental models of viewers. }

The duration of this die-off is of variable length, and appears to be getting shorter and shorter over time (e.g. the die off for ``1953'' was longer than for ``2003''). This change in event timing is distinct enough that the euclidean distance between year words may be quite different. Figure \protect\ref{fig:mseyear} shows the results from the Mean Squared Error (MSE) metric; there are many potentially irrelevant matches. Figure \protect\ref{fig:dtwyear}, by contrast, uses dynamic time warping to align the series. All of top results are year words, allowing comparison across the dataset.}
